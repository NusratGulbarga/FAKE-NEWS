readme_content = """# Fake News Detection Using Flask and Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Fake News Detection System** that uses **Flask**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Machine Learning** to classify news articles as **fake or real**. The model is trained using NLP techniques and integrated into a Flask web application for easy interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
```
- Flask - Backend web framework for API and web interface.
- Pandas - Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn - ML model training and evaluation.
- Machine Learning - Text classification model (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, or other classifiers).
```

## 📦 Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION.git
cd FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION

# Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training
```bash
# Prepare Data: Ensure you have a dataset (data/fake_news.csv or similar)

# Train the Model
python model.py

# Check for saved model
echo "Check if saved_model.pkl is generated"
```

## 🚀 Running the Flask App
```bash
python app.py

# Open the app in your browser
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🎯 Features
```
✔️ Upload News Text: Users can input a news article for classification.
✔️ Real-time Prediction: The ML model instantly classifies news as Fake or Real.
✔️ User-friendly UI: Simple web interface using Flask and HTML/CSS.
✔️ Custom Model Training: Train your model using any dataset.
```

## 📌 Future Enhancements
```
🔹 Deep Learning Model using LSTMs or Transformers.
🔹 API Integration for broader accessibility.
🔹 Multi-Language Support for news detection.
```
